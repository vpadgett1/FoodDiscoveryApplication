            Have you ever been recommended to a restaurant by
            a friend or parent and as soon as you needed a place
            to eat you couldn‚Äôt remember the restaurant name? Or
            you are in a new part of town and are looking for a
            place to eat but you don‚Äôt know anywhere that may be
            good. This is where FoodMe comes in. We‚Äôre here to
            allow you to check out your friends and families
            recommendations for local places to eat without the
            worry of forgetting the name or having nowhere to eat.
            Plus, you get the added bonus of seeing if your friends
            post a picture of the food or give a dish recommendation
            as well if you have no clue on what to eat.

            The question is: how is FoodMe different from any other food
            application to search for restaurants. We bring in the
            social aspect! You can add your friends and see what they‚Äôve
            been eating and the dishes they recommend. Looking for
            recommendations from your favorite people, then this is why
            you need to use FoodMe!

            As food accounts on instagram, facebook, twitter, etc are
            increasing we thought, why not create an app as a circle for
            foodies. This application is gathering all the foodies and
            those interested to become one!

            Restaurants can create an account to interact with their consumers
            by creating posts detailing promotions or specials or even just to
            showcase their latest dishes.
            Restaurants can also interact on consumers
            {'\' '}
            posts to let consumers know they
            loved their review or ask questions on how to improve.

          We are FoodMe, a company that wants to provide you with a platform
          for receiving food recommendations from your friends. The idea
          stemmed from our lack of knowledge about the different places around
          our college campus that were either well recommended by our peers
          or avoided at all costs. We wanted to be able to get recommendations
          restaurants from our friends in a quick and easy to view format and
          decided to bring our wish to life for everyone to be able to use and
          share. Our team continues to work hard to bring you your friends
          recommendations for restaurants that you can look back on days later
          so you aren‚Äôt googling and hoping you remember the name they told you.
